# Real Estate Management System 🏡

A MySQL database system designed to manage rental properties, tenants, leases, rent payments, and expenses across multiple real estate companies. This project demonstrates my ability to design relational databases, enforce data integrity, and organize complex information using SQL.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `REMSdatabase.sql` – Contains all `CREATE TABLE` statements to build the database schema.
- `REMSdata.sql` – Populates the database with sample data across all tables.
- `Sample'queries.sql` – Includes example queries for data retrieval and analysis.
- `EERDiagram.png` – Visual entity-relationship diagram of the database.

## 🧩 Key Features

- Multi-company property management
- Tracks houses and apartment complexes separately
- Supports tenant history, lease tracking, and rent changes
- 3NF-normalized structure for data efficiency and integrity

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- MySQL
- SQL (DDL & DML)
- Entity-Relationship Modeling

## 💡 Learning Highlights

- Database normalization (1NF → 3NF)
- Designing scalable and maintainable data models
- Writing efficient and readable SQL queries
- Mapping real-world business logic into relational structures
